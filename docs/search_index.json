People equated it with the flu from the beginning, and later became more and more aware of the harm caused by this virus. Over time, although people have begun to develop vaccines to minimize the spread of COVID-19, COVID-19 is constantly mutating. Every day there are new infections and deaths. Therefore, in this project, we would like to study some issues about COVID-19. Specifically, this is mainly divided into three parts. The first part is the impact of the vaccination and the spread of the epidemic. The second part mainly studies the relationship between hospital capacity and mortality.The last part of the study is.. In the first part, analysis are based on the data collected from the United States. With knowledge that after vaccination started in United States, cases and death dropped significantly at the beginning, but after a while, a turning point appeared and now the cases are increasing just like before vaccination. The analysis will be done for the impact of Coronavirus vaccination on the prevalence and mortality. We will start from whole country and then break down to serious state to try to figure out why cases are increasing with huge number of vaccinations. The second part uses data distributed by states in the United States. It mainly includes the number of hospital beds in each state, the diagnosis rate in a specific time period, the rate of consultations and the mortality rate. So it can be analysed that whether there is a relationship between hospital capacity and mortality, and the relationship between hospitalization and mortality. The last part. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Vaccination data 2.2 COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa 2.3 United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State", " Chapter 2 Data sources In this project, we have three data sources 2.1 Vaccination data We collected vaccination data from an organization called Our World in Data. They gather vaccination information of United States from official and update the data in a daily basis. The daily cases and death data are gathered from Center for Systems Science and Engineering at John Hopkins University. Its updated every 24 hours as well. For the vaccination data, there are 14 features. The names of them are listed below: ## [1] &quot;date&quot; &quot;location&quot; ## [3] &quot;total_vaccinations&quot; &quot;total_distributed&quot; ## [5] &quot;people_vaccinated&quot; &quot;people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred&quot; ## [7] &quot;total_vaccinations_per_hundred&quot; &quot;people_fully_vaccinated&quot; ## [9] &quot;people_vaccinated_per_hundred&quot; &quot;distributed_per_hundred&quot; ## [11] &quot;daily_vaccinations_raw&quot; &quot;daily_vaccinations&quot; ## [13] &quot;daily_vaccinations_per_million&quot; &quot;share_doses_used&quot; The starting date of this dataset is 2021-01-12 and the last day is yesterday. The first problem we noticed was that in location, there are many places that are not US states. Like Bureau of Prisons,Dept of Defense Therefore, the first step that we did was to filter out these none-states. Then we found a common issue, missing data. We visualized it in missing values chapter and decided to do a backward filling. Because most of these missing values were not continuous, we could simply use the latest values to fill in these missing spots. For the cases and death data, the raw data put every day as a column therefore we first converted these columns to rows. ## [1] &quot;UID&quot; &quot;iso2&quot; &quot;iso3&quot; &quot;code3&quot; &quot;FIPS&quot; ## [6] &quot;Admin2&quot; &quot;Province_State&quot; &quot;Country_Region&quot; &quot;Lat&quot; &quot;Long_&quot; ## [11] &quot;Combined_Key&quot; &quot;1/22/20&quot; &quot;1/23/20&quot; &quot;1/24/20&quot; &quot;1/25/20&quot; The starting date of this dataset is 2020-01-22 and the last day is yesterday. When we tried to calculate daily growing cases and death from cummulative data, we noticed that there were mistakes when collecting these data because some of the growing numbers were negative. We used the same filling method as in vaccination data. 2.2 COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa This data-set provides facility-level data for hospital utilization aggregated on a weekly basis (Friday to Thursday) in the time period from 2020-07-31 to 2021-11-26. It is mainly collected from two sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities. There are 106 features with 309719 records in the original data-set, but not all of those features are useful for our analysis, so we only select 6 specific features from 106 original features. These selected features including date, state, capacities of hospitals and number of hospitalized patients who are confirmed with COVID-19. We also noticed that there is value -999999 in data-set which is not a reasonable value. Replacing -999999 with 2 since it represents sums and averages less than four, so use average to replace that. Because we want to compare the information between states, so group the data-set by state is also needed. Moreover, as the summary of the data-set shows below, there are missing values in features. Therefore, we also need to handle the NA values in the later process. ## hospital_pk colle_week state total_beds adu_conf ## Length:349655 Min. :2020-07-31 Length:349655 Min. : 0 Min. : 0.00 ## Class :character 1st Qu.:2020-11-27 Class :character 1st Qu.: 195 1st Qu.: 0.00 ## Mode :character Median :2021-04-02 Mode :character Median : 490 Median : 16.00 ## Mean :2021-03-30 Mean : 1152 Mean : 73.14 ## 3rd Qu.:2021-07-30 3rd Qu.: 1524 3rd Qu.: 77.00 ## Max. :2021-11-26 Max. :35108 Max. :9071.00 ## NA&#39;s :1294 NA&#39;s :2720 ## ped_conf total_icu_beds ## Min. :-40.0000 Min. : 0.0 ## 1st Qu.: 0.0000 1st Qu.: 0.0 ## Median : 0.0000 Median : 49.0 ## Mean : 0.9217 Mean : 152.3 ## 3rd Qu.: 0.0000 3rd Qu.: 168.0 ## Max. :519.0000 Max. :5949.0 ## NA&#39;s :3067 NA&#39;s :2064 2.3 United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State This data-set is collected by CDC, which includes counts of COVID-19 cases and death numbers daily in the time period form 2020-01-22 to 2021-12-07. CDC collects and organizes these data based on these most recent numbers reported by states, territories, and other jurisdictions. There are 41160 records with 15 features in the original data-set, and each record represents a specific date for a specific state. We only keep 3 features which are state, total number of cases and total number of death for our further analysis. Because we want to merge this data-set with COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa, so it is important to make sure they are in the same time period. Since the time range for COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa is smaller, so the subset of original data-set is generated with the time period from 2020-07-31 to 2021-11-26. The sub data-set has 29040 records with 3 features. Note that for the features tot_cases and tot_death, they are cumulative features during the time period. Moreover, to compare between state, we add population column to calculate the percentage. ## state submission_date tot_cases tot_death population ## Length:25168 Min. :2020-07-31 Min. : 1295 Min. : 26 Min. : 581075 ## Class :character 1st Qu.:2020-11-28 1st Qu.: 102344 1st Qu.: 1577 1st Qu.: 1837057 ## Mode :character Median :2021-03-29 Median : 282938 Median : 5124 Median : 4385076 ## Mean :2021-03-29 Mean : 500481 Mean : 8727 Mean : 6433422 ## 3rd Qu.:2021-07-28 3rd Qu.: 651956 3rd Qu.:11012 3rd Qu.: 7589312 ## Max. :2021-11-26 Max. :5045388 Max. :73365 Max. :39613493 "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Vaccination, case, and death data 3.2 Relationship between morbidity and mortality and hospital capacity", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Vaccination, case, and death data The code is in data/data_preprocessing.R For this part, there are 3 datasets: vaccination, cases, and death.

We extracted whole country data and we can see that each row represents a day from 2020-12-20 to now. The information is updated everyday. There are lots of missing values in the table and we are going to use different methods to visualize it. 4.1.2 Missing value counts by column ## num_missing ## daily_vaccinations_raw 50 ## people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred 45 ## people_fully_vaccinated 45 ## total_distributed 44 ## people_vaccinated 44 ## people_vaccinated_per_hundred 44 ## distributed_per_hundred 44 ## share_doses_used 44 ## total_vaccinations 31 ## total_vaccinations_per_hundred 31 ## daily_vaccinations 1 ## daily_vaccinations_per_million 1 ## date 0 ## location 0 This is the missing value counts by different features. According to this table, we can see that the feature daily_vaccinations_raw has the largest number of missing values. And for some features, they have similar number of missing values. Such as people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred and people_fully_vaccinated, both of them have number of missing values equal to 35, also, according the the features names, it can be guessed that there is a correlation between this two value, which may be the number of missing value in people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred is dependent on the feature people_fully_vaccinated, so they always have the missing value at the same time. 4.1.3 Missing value counts by row ## # A tibble: 9 x 2 ## date num_missing ## * &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2020-12 109 ## 2 2021-01 125 ## 3 2021-02 11 ## 4 2021-05 10 ## 5 2021-06 1 ## 6 2021-07 11 ## 7 2021-09 32 ## 8 2021-10 42 ## 9 2021-11 83 Each row in the original dataframe represents a specific day. However, there are too many rows that have missing values. Therefore, we count missing values by month. December 2020 and January 2021 have the greatest number of missing values. This is reasonable as vaccination just started and its hard to get all data well-organized. 4.1.4 Heatmap In order to see the missing patterns we have for this dataframe, we can use heatmap. It can be observed that rows that have missing values all at once by using this heatmap. However, since there are 330 rows in the us_whole_vaccination dataframe, it is hard to summarize the missing value patterns without showing the whole graph. Moreover, as looking through the graph, several rows have the similar missing value patterns. So instead of showing the heatmap for each row, plot just show the different missing value patterns for the dataset is prefered. This missing value plot is a combination of all the information above. It consists of three plots. The main plot is the heatmap on the bottom left. It summarized different missing value patterns among all rows. The blue block in each column represents there are missing values in this column. According to the main plot, it shows that there are 7 different patterns for us_whole_vaccination dataset, which are represented by each row of the heatmap. The first row in the heatmap represents the complete cases, which means there is no missing value for rows in this pattern. By looking through this plot, there is a correlation between some features as mentioned in 4.2. For example, for features people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred and people_fully_vaccinated, in each pattern, their missing value always occurred in the same time. Similar for features total_distributed, people_vaccinated, people_vaccinated_per_hundred, distributed_per_hundred, and share_doses_used, daily_vaccinations and daily_vaccinations_per_million, and total_vaccinations and total_vaccinations_per_hundred. It indicates that for some of these features, it maybe reasonable to only keep one feature from each group. For example, keep people_fully_vaccinated and remove people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred. The barplot on the right is the row count plot. It tells us the number of rows that each pattern can apply. It shows that the complete cases pattern has the most largest number of rows. From this plot, it shows that pattern 2 has the largest number of rows with missing data. By checking with this pattern, it contains 10 features that are missing. A reasonable guess is that the most of data for this pattern comes from December 2020 and January 2021. Crossing checking with the heatmap for each row in 4.4, this guess is confirmed. The barplot on the top is a visualization of 4.2. It shows how many rows contain missing values of different features. As there are not many missing rows, we might remove missing patter 2, 4, 5, and 7 as over 50% of the features are missing. For pattern 3 and 6, we can use mean or median to fill the missing values. 4.2 COVID-19_Hospital_Capacity In order to see if there is any state has large number of missing values, missing table was built based on the data set before transformation. Below is the first five rows of the missing-value table. It counts the number of missing value in each feature for each state. According to the table, it indicates that there is no state that has more than half of its records are missing value. Therefore, for total_beds, total_icu_beds, aud_conf and ped_conf, choose the average value of these features in each state to replace the missing value. ## state hospital_pk colle_week total_beds adu_conf ped_conf total_icu_beds n ## 1 AK 0 0 0 5 5 17 996 ## 2 AL 0 0 1 15 16 2 6769 ## 3 AR 0 0 0 25 25 30 5916 ## 4 AS 0 0 0 0 0 0 15 ## 5 AZ 0 0 10 33 93 89 5165 ## 6 CA 0 0 0 41 73 8 24754 4.3 COVID-19_Case_Death This is the missing value counts by different features for COVID-19_Case_Death data-set. According to this table, we can see that there is no missing value for this data-set. ## num_missing ## state 0 ## submission_date 0 ## tot_cases 0 ## tot_death 0 ## population 0 "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 US time series 5.2 US cumulative cases 5.3 Latest cummulative cases and deaths 5.4 Latest vaccination situation 5.5 Time series of serious states 5.6 Distribution 5.7 Percentage of number of beds in population VS death rate 5.8 inpatient rate and death rate", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 US time series This graph shows the time series of confirmed cases growth and people vaccinated growth. Its obvious that when people vaccinated growth number is high, confirmed cases growth speed decreases and when people vaccinated low, confirmed cases increases again. This plot confirms that vaccination helps to prevent covid spread. 5.2 US cumulative cases This is a map that shows cumulative confirmed cases in United States on 12/9/2021. Red points mean confirmed cases and the size represents exact number. The higher the number, the larger the spot. We can see that large cities are serious spots. This graph gives us a general view of current covid situation. 5.3 Latest cummulative cases and deaths The graphs above shows current confirmed cases and death of 50 states. We can see that California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Illinois are top 5 states with most confirmed cases. California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania are top 5 states with most deaths. 5.4 Latest vaccination situation As there are 12 features in our vaccination data, we use a correlation heatmap to select the most relevant features to confirmed cases and deaths. From the graph above we can see the top 4 features are total vaccinations, total distributed, people vaccinated, and people fully vaccinated. We will use people vaccinated and people fully vaccinated as two features to represent vaccination. The 5 states with most deaths also have the largest number of people vaccinated. However, none of them are on top of the list of people fully vaccinated. 5.5 Time series of serious states There is a significant outlier in original people_vaccinated daily growth graph. Because from October 2nd to November 28th, the people_vaccinated information in Pennsylvania is missing. We are doing a filling by pervious data, therefore there exists a huge pike. We have to delete the data of that day. 5.6 Distribution This scatterplot shows cumulative people fully vaccinated vs. cases in all states. We can easily see the outliers among 50 states. If we see in ratio, theres no significantly high or low states. 5.7 Percentage of number of beds in population VS death rate According to the graph, there is no clear trend between the percentage of beds inn population and the death rate. Especially when we ignore the state which has more than 0.035. Its different from what we initially imagined, when capacity of hospital in a state increase, the mortality rate will drop. It may cause by several reasons. The first reason may be due to inaccurate mortality. Because the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of flu, many people will mistakenly think that they are flu instead of COVID-19, leading to deviations in statistical data. The second possibility is that there are other factors, such as the number of ventilators or whether the isolation measures are effective. These are also factors that can affect mortality. 5.8 inpatient rate and death rate Form the above graph, we can see that death rate increase as the inpatient rate increases. There are two possible explanations. The first one is people would not go to hospital unless they are in very bad situation. Thus as the number of impatient increase, death rate increase. The second explanation is consider about the time range. There is no very useful way to cure COVID-19 patient. Thus as inpatient number increase, death rate increase.

"],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion In this project, we encountered lots of problems and learned a lot in the process of solving these issues. After we got the raw data, missing value was the first problem that we need to deal with. There were lots of techniques to choose to solve missing values, like forward filling, backward filling, fill by means, delete For different types of features, we used different methods by doing lots of research online. When we were doing data cleaning and transformation, we found that some of the data was wrong when being collected. We had to find means to correct these values. When it came to the graphs, things were more complicated. We learned a lot of visualization techniques in this semesters class and we needed to find the proper graphs to tell our data story. All graphs had to be well-designed and could help to explain the main idea. In the future, we can improve our graphs by using better methods, like putting bar plots side by side. D3 is a powerful technique. We only used a little in this project. It doesnt require a server to run like shiny app. We can design more interactive graphs that can explain our ideas to our readers better. "]]
