[["index.html", "Covid 19 Project Chapter 1 Introduction", " Covid 19 Project Ruize Yu, Jiazhen Li, Wenxin Zhang 2021-12-13 Chapter 1 Introduction Beginning in 2020, COVID-19 has begun to spread all over the world. People equated it with the flu from the beginning, and later became more and more aware of the harm caused by this virus. Over time, although people have begun to develop vaccines to minimize the spread of COVID-19, COVID-19 is constantly mutating. Every day there are new infections and deaths. Therefore, in this project, we would like to study some issues about COVID-19. Specifically, this is mainly divided into three parts. The first part is the impact of the vaccination and the spread of the epidemic. The second part mainly studies the relationship between hospital capacity and mortality.The last part of the study is.. In the first part, analysis are based on the data collected from the United States. With knowledge that after vaccination started in United States, cases and death dropped significantly at the beginning, but after a while, a turning point appeared and now the cases are increasing just like before vaccination. The analysis will be done for the impact of Coronavirus vaccination on the prevalence and mortality. We will start from whole country and then break down to serious state to try to figure out why cases are increasing with huge number of vaccinations. The second part uses data distributed by states in the United States. It mainly includes the number of hospital beds in each state, the diagnosis rate in a specific time period, the rate of consultations and the mortality rate. So it can be analysed that whether there is a relationship between hospital capacity and mortality, and the relationship between hospitalization and mortality. The last part focus on life expectancy and covid. Two studies have reported that life expectancy has been shortened by nearly two years by 2020 as a result of 2019 coronavirus disease. Bad as it sounds, what does it mean? Life expectancy reflects the level of development of a country, or the proportion of the elderly population, the older the population. So it is easier to combine COVID-19 with the elderly.We make an analysis of a relationship between life expectancy and total number of cases per million population. Do the number of confirmed cases is positively correlated with the life expectancy? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Vaccination data 2.2 COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa 2.3 United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State 2.4 Life expectancy data", " Chapter 2 Data sources In this project, we have three data sources 2.1 Vaccination data We collected vaccination data from an organization called Our World in Data. They gather vaccination information of United States from official and update the data in a daily basis. The daily cases and death data are gathered from Center for Systems Science and Engineering at John Hopkins University. Its updated every 24 hours as well. For the vaccination data, there are 14 features. The names of them are listed below: ## [1] &quot;date&quot; &quot;location&quot; &quot;total_vaccinations&quot; &quot;total_distributed&quot; &quot;people_vaccinated&quot; ## [6] &quot;people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred&quot; &quot;total_vaccinations_per_hundred&quot; &quot;people_fully_vaccinated&quot; &quot;people_vaccinated_per_hundred&quot; &quot;distributed_per_hundred&quot; ## [11] &quot;daily_vaccinations_raw&quot; &quot;daily_vaccinations&quot; &quot;daily_vaccinations_per_million&quot; &quot;share_doses_used&quot; The starting date of this dataset is 2021-01-12 and the last day is yesterday. The first problem we noticed was that in location, there are many places that are not US states. Like Bureau of Prisons,Dept of Defense Therefore, the first step that we did was to filter out these none-states. Then we found a common issue, missing data. We visualized it in missing values chapter and decided to do a backward filling. Because most of these missing values were not continuous, we could simply use the latest values to fill in these missing spots. For the cases and death data, the raw data put every day as a column therefore we first converted these columns to rows. ## [1] &quot;UID&quot; &quot;iso2&quot; &quot;iso3&quot; &quot;code3&quot; &quot;FIPS&quot; &quot;Admin2&quot; &quot;Province_State&quot; &quot;Country_Region&quot; &quot;Lat&quot; &quot;Long_&quot; &quot;Combined_Key&quot; ## [12] &quot;1/22/20&quot; &quot;1/23/20&quot; &quot;1/24/20&quot; &quot;1/25/20&quot; The starting date of this dataset is 2020-01-22 and the last day is yesterday. When we tried to calculate daily growing cases and death from cummulative data, we noticed that there were mistakes when collecting these data because some of the growing numbers were negative. We used the same filling method as in vaccination data. 2.2 COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa This data-set provides facility-level data for hospital utilization aggregated on a weekly basis (Friday to Thursday) in the time period from 2020-07-31 to 2021-11-26. It is mainly collected from two sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities. There are 106 features with 309719 records in the original data-set, but not all of those features are useful for our analysis, so we only select 6 specific features from 106 original features. These selected features including date, state, capacities of hospitals and number of hospitalized patients who are confirmed with COVID-19. We also noticed that there is value -999999 in data-set which is not a reasonable value. Replacing -999999 with 2 since it represents sums and averages less than four, so use average to replace that. Because we want to compare the information between states, so group the data-set by state is also needed. Moreover, as the summary of the data-set shows below, there are missing values in features. Therefore, we also need to handle the NA values in the later process. ## hospital_pk colle_week state total_beds adu_conf ped_conf total_icu_beds ## Length:354733 Min. :2020-07-31 Length:354733 Min. : 0 Min. : 0.00 Min. :-40.0000 Min. : 0.0 ## Class :character 1st Qu.:2020-11-27 Class :character 1st Qu.: 194 1st Qu.: 0.00 1st Qu.: 0.0000 1st Qu.: 0.0 ## Mode :character Median :2021-04-02 Mode :character Median : 490 Median : 16.00 Median : 0.0000 Median : 49.0 ## Mean :2021-04-02 Mean : 1153 Mean : 73.22 Mean : 0.9242 Mean : 152.4 ## 3rd Qu.:2021-08-06 3rd Qu.: 1526 3rd Qu.: 77.00 3rd Qu.: 0.0000 3rd Qu.: 168.0 ## Max. :2021-12-03 Max. :35108 Max. :9071.00 Max. :519.0000 Max. :5949.0 ## NA&#39;s :1294 NA&#39;s :2720 NA&#39;s :3070 NA&#39;s :2064 2.3 United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State This data-set is collected by CDC, which includes counts of COVID-19 cases and death numbers daily in the time period form 2020-01-22 to 2021-12-07. CDC collects and organizes these data based on these most recent numbers reported by states, territories, and other jurisdictions. There are 41160 records with 15 features in the original data-set, and each record represents a specific date for a specific state. We only keep 3 features which are state, total number of cases and total number of death for our further analysis. Because we want to merge this data-set with COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa, so it is important to make sure they are in the same time period. Since the time range for COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa is smaller, so the subset of original data-set is generated with the time period from 2020-07-31 to 2021-11-26. The sub data-set has 29040 records with 3 features. Note that for the features tot_cases and tot_death, they are cumulative features during the time period. Moreover, to compare between state, we add population column to calculate the percentage. ## state submission_date tot_cases tot_death population ## Length:25532 Min. :2020-07-31 Min. : 1295 Min. : 26 Min. : 581075 ## Class :character 1st Qu.:2020-11-30 1st Qu.: 103570 1st Qu.: 1595 1st Qu.: 1837057 ## Mode :character Median :2021-04-02 Median : 287450 Median : 5164 Median : 4385076 ## Mean :2021-04-02 Mean : 506323 Mean : 8807 Mean : 6433422 ## 3rd Qu.:2021-08-03 3rd Qu.: 659642 3rd Qu.:11100 3rd Qu.: 7589312 ## Max. :2021-12-03 Max. :5084927 Max. :74046 Max. :39613493 2.4 Life expectancy data Our complete owid_covid_data data set is collected from Our World in Data. It is updated daily and includes data on confirmed cases, deaths and testing. The dataset can be downloaded from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data. Confirmed cases and deaths of our data comes from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). Full description of all variables is available in the codebook or online: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/ Most variable names are self-explanatory and there are too many of them. However, we do not need all of those features for our analysis, so we only select 9 features. These selected features including continent, location, date iso_code, total_cases, new_cases, total_cases_per_million, new_cases_per_million and life_expectancy. After all, the data on the new crown can not be statistically comprehensive, so there are missing values in this data set, so we deal with the missing values.

We extracted whole country data and we can see that each row represents a day from 2020-12-20 to now. The information is updated everyday. There are lots of missing values in the table and we are going to use different methods to visualize it. 4.1.2 Missing value counts by column ## num_missing ## daily_vaccinations_raw 50 ## people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred 45 ## people_fully_vaccinated 45 ## total_distributed 44 ## people_vaccinated 44 ## people_vaccinated_per_hundred 44 ## distributed_per_hundred 44 ## share_doses_used 44 ## total_vaccinations 31 ## total_vaccinations_per_hundred 31 ## daily_vaccinations 1 ## daily_vaccinations_per_million 1 ## date 0 ## location 0 This is the missing value counts by different features. According to this table, we can see that the feature daily_vaccinations_raw has the largest number of missing values. And for some features, they have similar number of missing values. Such as people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred and people_fully_vaccinated, both of them have number of missing values equal to 35, also, according the the features names, it can be guessed that there is a correlation between this two value, which may be the number of missing value in people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred is dependent on the feature people_fully_vaccinated, so they always have the missing value at the same time. 4.1.3 Missing value counts by row ## # A tibble: 9 x 2 ## date num_missing ## * &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2020-12 109 ## 2 2021-01 125 ## 3 2021-02 11 ## 4 2021-05 10 ## 5 2021-06 1 ## 6 2021-07 11 ## 7 2021-09 32 ## 8 2021-10 42 ## 9 2021-11 83 Each row in the original dataframe represents a specific day. However, there are too many rows that have missing values. Therefore, we count missing values by month. December 2020 and January 2021 have the greatest number of missing values. This is reasonable as vaccination just started and its hard to get all data well-organized. 4.1.4 Heatmap In order to see the missing patterns we have for this dataframe, we can use heatmap. It can be observed that rows that have missing values all at once by using this heatmap. However, since there are 330 rows in the us_whole_vaccination dataframe, it is hard to summarize the missing value patterns without showing the whole graph. Moreover, as looking through the graph, several rows have the similar missing value patterns. So instead of showing the heatmap for each row, plot just show the different missing value patterns for the dataset is prefered. This missing value plot is a combination of all the information above. It consists of three plots. The main plot is the heatmap on the bottom left. It summarized different missing value patterns among all rows. The blue block in each column represents there are missing values in this column. According to the main plot, it shows that there are 7 different patterns for us_whole_vaccination dataset, which are represented by each row of the heatmap. The first row in the heatmap represents the complete cases, which means there is no missing value for rows in this pattern. By looking through this plot, there is a correlation between some features as mentioned in 4.2. For example, for features people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred and people_fully_vaccinated, in each pattern, their missing value always occurred in the same time. Similar for features total_distributed, people_vaccinated, people_vaccinated_per_hundred, distributed_per_hundred, and share_doses_used, daily_vaccinations and daily_vaccinations_per_million, and total_vaccinations and total_vaccinations_per_hundred. It indicates that for some of these features, it maybe reasonable to only keep one feature from each group. For example, keep people_fully_vaccinated and remove people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred. The barplot on the right is the row count plot. It tells us the number of rows that each pattern can apply. It shows that the complete cases pattern has the most largest number of rows. From this plot, it shows that pattern 2 has the largest number of rows with missing data. By checking with this pattern, it contains 10 features that are missing. A reasonable guess is that the most of data for this pattern comes from December 2020 and January 2021. Crossing checking with the heatmap for each row in 4.4, this guess is confirmed. The barplot on the top is a visualization of 4.2. It shows how many rows contain missing values of different features. As there are not many missing rows, we might remove missing patter 2, 4, 5, and 7 as over 50% of the features are missing. For pattern 3 and 6, we can use mean or median to fill the missing values. 4.2 COVID-19_Hospital_Capacity In order to see if there is any state has large number of missing values, missing table was built based on the data set before transformation. Below is the first five rows of the missing-value table. It counts the number of missing value in each feature for each state. According to the table, it indicates that there is no state that has more than half of its records are missing value. Therefore, for total_beds, total_icu_beds, aud_conf and ped_conf, choose the average value of these features in each state to replace the missing value. ## state hospital_pk colle_week total_beds adu_conf ped_conf total_icu_beds n ## 1 AK 0 0 0 5 5 17 1010 ## 2 AL 0 0 1 15 16 2 6866 ## 3 AR 0 0 0 25 25 30 6003 ## 4 AS 0 0 0 0 0 0 16 ## 5 AZ 0 0 10 33 93 89 5240 ## 6 CA 0 0 0 41 74 8 25107 4.3 COVID-19_Case_Death This is the missing value counts by different features for COVID-19_Case_Death data-set. According to this table, we can see that there is no missing value for this data-set. ## num_missing ## state 0 ## submission_date 0 ## tot_cases 0 ## tot_death 0 ## population 0 4.4 Life Expectancy Data ## iso_code continent location date total_cases new_cases total_cases_per_million new_cases_per_million ## 0 8812 0 0 7688 7693 8358 8363 ## life_expectancy ## 9728 We only select 9 features and these selected features including continent, location, date iso_code, total_cases, new_cases, total_cases_per_million, new_cases_per_million and life_expectancy. This is the missing value counts by different features. We use map_db() to solve these missing value problem and after we find them and count their number, we omit them by omit() and get a new dataset. From this table, we can see that the feature iso_code , location and date are comprehensive.

It indicates the cumulative confirmed cases in United States on 12/9/2021. Each red point represents the number of confirmed cases in a city, and the size of the point reflects the relative amount of the exact number. The higher the number, the larger the spot. Form this map, we can see that larger cities are having a larger number of cases. To be more clear, we use the bar chart to show the current cumulative confirmed cases and number of death in 50 states. By comparing these two graphs, it shows that state with more confirmed cases generally has a higher number of death. Form these two graphs, we can see that California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Illinois are top 5 states with most confirmed cases. California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania are top 5 states with most number of deaths. 5.1 Impact of the vaccination on the spread of the epidemic To show the impact of the vaccination and the spread of the epidemic, as there are 12 features in our vaccination data, we first want to find which features have the strong correlation with the number of cases. Therefore, we use a correlation heatmap to select the most relevant features to confirmed cases and deaths. From the graph above, we can see the top 4 features with highest correlations are total vaccinations, total distributed, people vaccinated, and people fully vaccinated. We will use people vaccinated and people fully vaccinated as two features to represent vaccination. People vaccinated includes both one does vaccination and fully vaccinated data. And fully vaccinated feature only represents the number of people who are fully vaccinated. Below are the bar charts for these two features in 50 states. Form the chart for People vaccinated, it indicates that California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania are top 5 states with most number of vaccination. Which is corresponding to the top 5 states with most number of deaths. This may because the population of these five states are large, which will cause them to become the five states with the highest number of both vaccination and deaths. However, none of them are on top of the list of people fully vaccinated. So it may indicate that one does vaccination can not effectively help to stop the spread of the epidemic, but fully vaccination can achieve this. To show the relationship between people vaccinated, people fully vaccinated, number of cases and number of death more clearly, we plot the time series graphs for each features for the top 5 states mentioned before, which are California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania. In the original graph, there is a significant outlier in people_vaccinated daily growth graph. That is because from October 2nd to November 28th, the people_vaccinated information in Pennsylvania is missing. Although we tried to fill it by previous data, there still exists a unreasonable huge pike. Therefore, we delete the data of that time period. But after the cleaning of data, we can see in the graph that as the number of vaccinations is in an increasing trend, the number of confirmed cases and death will growth in a decreasing rate. And when the number of vaccinations is keeping in a low number, although in the short run, the number of confirmed cases and death will also keep in a low increasing rate, in the long run, it will increase and even achieve a highest point. To show this trend more clearly, instead of only focusing on the data of these top five state, we will use the data for the United States. The graph below shows the time series of confirmed cases growth and people vaccinated growth in the United States. Form the graph, we can say the similar trend as before. The trend from Jan 2021 to April 2021 shows clearly that when people vaccinated number grew in a high speed, confirmed cases growth speed decreased. For the time period between April 2021 and July 2021, although the number of confirmed cases still decreased as the vaccinated number decreased, it was in a lower decreasing rate compared with the previous time range. This trend was proved in the later time range which is after July 2021. As the number of growth in vaccination was keeping in a low value, the number of confirmed cases turned to increase and reached its highest point in about September 2021. Therefore, this plot confirms that the increase in the number of vaccination will lead to a decrease in the number of confirmed cases, thus, it helps to prevent the COVID-19 spread. 5.2 Impact of the hospital capacity and inpatient rate on the death rate In addition to the relationship between vaccines and COVID-19, we also want to see whether the capacity of the hospital and the inpatient rate will have a certain impact on the mortality rate of COVID. We first plot a scatter plot to show the relationship between capacity of the hospital and the death rate. Because states with more populations will have more hospitals, in order to avoid the impact of different population in each state, we chose to divide the total number of beds in each state by the total population in each state to get the percentage of number of beds in population. According to the graph, there is no clear trend between the percentage of beds in population and the death rate. Especially when we ignore the state which has more than 0.035. Its different from what we initially imagined, when capacity of hospital in a state increase, the mortality rate will drop. It may cause by several reasons. The first reason may be due to inaccurate mortality. Because the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of flu, many people will mistakenly think that they are flu instead of COVID-19, leading to deviations in statistical data. The second possibility is that there are other factors, such as the different in the number of ventilators or the different isolation rules in each state. These are also factors that can affect mortality. Therefore, although from this graph, there is no obvious relationship between the hospital capacity and death rate, we can not give a definite conclusion. We then plot a scatter plot to show the relationship between hospitalization rate and the death rate. Form the above graph, we can see that death rate increase as the hospitalization rate increases. There are two possible explanations. The first one is people would not go to hospital unless they are in very bad situation. Thus as the number of impatient increase, death rate increase. The second explanation is consider about the time range. There is no very useful way to cure COVID-19 patient in that time period. Thus there is a positive relationship between inpatient number and death rate. 5.3 Impact of the We divide the countries in the data by each continent. Each country has only one life expectancy, so we draw the total cases per million of each country in each continent according to each life expectancy. We can see that the countries with higher life expectancy have more total cases per million. ## # A tibble: 193 x 2 ## location `total_cases[length(total_cases)]` ## * &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 157508 ## 2 Albania 202295 ## 3 Algeria 211859 ## 4 Andorra 18815 ## 5 Angola 65301 ## 6 Antigua and Barbuda 4148 ## 7 Argentina 5346242 ## 8 Armenia 341058 ## 9 Australia 222260 ## 10 Austria 1207336 ## # ... with 183 more rows This graph can help us make an analysis of the progress of total cases per million for the following countries: China, India, Sweden, Russia, United Kingdom, United States. The flattening curve means slowing down the rate of infections. The cumulative curve can help us see the cumulative change of infection cases every day. This can help hospitals manage the process of cases. It can help the hospital prepare and distribute wards, medical equipment, and medical supplies. These two graph are able to help us make an analysis of the progress of number of new cases and the progress of number of new cases per million divided by location for the following countries: China, India, Sweden, Russia, United Kingdom, United States. These two graphs show the changes in the number of new infections per day. We can see the number of new infection cases in each country in each time period and the comparison of the number of new infection cases in each country in the same time period. We can see a sudden increase in the number of new infections in India in a few days, and the United States has maintained the number of new infections for a period of time. Life expectancy reflects a countrys development level, or the proportion of the elderly population. The longer a countrys life expectancy, the greater the proportion of the elderly population in the total population. Therefore, we analyzed the relationship between the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 and life expectancy. According to the data and statistical analysis provided by who, we can see that there is a positive correlation between life expectancy and confirmed cases of coronavirus. ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: data_relation$total_cases_per_million ## t = 21.06, df = 2280, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 10398.08 12533.34 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## 11465.71 ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: data_relation$life_expectancy ## t = 880.18, df = 2280, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 71.84826 72.16912 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## 72.00869 ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: data_relation$total_cases_per_million and data_relation$life_expectancy ## t = 23.453, df = 2279, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4072702 0.4734161 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.4409417 "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Top 5 series states", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Top 5 series states Cases Deaths People Fully Vaccinated This interactive graph shows total cases, deaths, and people fully vaccinated numbers on 2021-12-9.

"],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion The first part is to investigate whether vaccination has an impact on the spread of COVID-19. By analyzing the five states with the largest number of vaccinations, we found that the vaccination rate is inversely related to the spread of the epidemic. This relationship has also been confirmed by national data. From this we can get that vaccination can curb the spread of the epidemic. The second part is to analyze the relationship between hospital-related data and mortality. According to analysis, we did not find a clear relationship between hospital capacity and mortality. This may be due to other factors affecting the relationship between these two. So, in order to further analyze, we will collect more hospital-related data, similar to data such as number of ventilators or the number of doctors. Under the control of other variables, we will do further analysis. Regarding the relationship between hospitalization rate and death rate, we found that hospitalization rate and death rate are positively correlated. One possible explanation is that people may only be hospitalized for treatment when they become severely ill. And because there is no specific medicine, it is difficult for severely ill patients to be cured, which leads to a positive correlation. The third part is to argue if covid will affect life expectancy. Life expectancy at birth, that is, the average life expectancy of newborns, is a general indicator to measure population mortality and health status. The analysis is as follows: First, age is a factor that causes so many COVID-19 deaths and diagnoses. From the data in the table, it can be known that the more severe the aging of the country or region, the greater the number of COVID-19 deaths. We have reason to believe that the elderly is more susceptible to the coronavirus and have a higher mortality rate. Second, each persons own underlying diseases and some complications are another important factor in the death rate of the COVID-19. People with these diseases are more susceptible to the virus than normal healthy people because they have problems with their own immune system. This problem is more likely to occur in the elderly. Elderly people with autoimmune system diseases and complications should take precautions and follow the doctors instructions to take medicine to avoid contracting COVID-19. From the above two important factors, we can see that for the elderly (the main target audience of the new coronavirus), what they must do is to protect themselves and seek medical treatment in time. Special services for the elderly should also be done in senior care institutions. The state finance should also provide appropriate subsidies and appropriations for these institutions to ensure that the elderly can also spend the rest of their lives healthily. In this project, we encountered lots of problems and learned a lot in the process of solving these issues. After we got the raw data, missing value was the first problem that we need to deal with. There were lots of techniques to choose to solve missing values, like forward filling, backward filling, fill by means, delete For different types of features, we used different methods by doing lots of research online. When we were doing data cleaning and transformation, we found that some of the data was wrong when being collected. We had to find means to correct these values. When it came to the graphs, things were more complicated. We learned a lot of visualization techniques in this semesters class and we needed to find the proper graphs to tell our data story. All graphs had to be well-designed and could help to explain the main idea. In the future, we can improve our graphs by using better methods, like putting bar plots side by side. D3 is a powerful technique. We only used a little in this project. It doesnt require a server to run like shiny app. We can design more interactive graphs that can explain our ideas to our readers better. "]]
